# PS3LicenseInstaller
Very simple script that allows to install fully automatically the licenses that have not been installed for the games that are already installed.
## How to use
- Run the PS3LicenseInstaller.exe file.
- Once opened, enter the IP address of your console and, if necessary, also enter the port with the following structure: ```IP:PORT``` (**":"is required**).
- If your console uses port 21 in FTP, just enter the IP address.
## Hey, where is the source code?
At the moment, **I wont share the source code**.

The reason is very simple: **Not everyone has Python** installed on their PC, and **not everyone knows how to install it and install the modules.**

For this very reason, and to ensure that users can download and use the script without worrying, **for now**, I will not share the source code.

**Although if I have thought to do it in another repository** not to confuse users.
